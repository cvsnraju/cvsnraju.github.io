D3 is pretty handy in handling GIS data and visualizing them, When dealing with more complex geodata like shapes or lines, you’ll necessarily deal with more complex data formats. You’ll want to use GeoJSON, which has become the standard for web-mapping data.
<br>

GeoJSON (geojson.org) is, like it sounds, a way of encoding geodata in JSON format. Each feature in a featureCollection is a JSON object that stores the border of the feature in a coordinates array as well as metadata about the feature in a properties hash object. For instance, if you wanted to draw a square that went around the island of Manhattan, it would have corners at [–74.0479, 40.6829], [–74.0479, 40.8820], [-73.9067, 40.8820], and [–73.9067, 40.6829],
