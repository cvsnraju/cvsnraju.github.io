On the morning of 13th June, My mother received a call from a private hospital requesting her to take the COVID-19 test to proceed with a Laparoscopy surgical procedure pending due to the COVID-19 lockdown. After the call, we immediately got in touch with the nearest Primary Health Care center of AP Government then came to the real surprise - "We are not doing coronavirus test; and we don't know how to get a person screened for test". 

It has been more than 3 months since the world is turmoiled by virus and our nearest public health care center doesn't have the equipment; even though the number of cases is very low in my community- 1 person tested positive in 10 KM radius as reported by ArogyaSetu App still there are no testing kits available to test asymptomatic persons.

Then we called to person, who asked us to take a test - Obviously; he too couldn't help to get us but promised to call back hoping to help. Later at 5 PM on the same day, we received a call from him to give samples at Bhimavaram Municipal Hospital as there is a daily drive going for testing both symptomatic & Asymptomatic people. 

Initially relieved but also fearful to travel, as this place is visited by real people who have been tested positive and by the doctors who treat them in close contact and we could be in a vulnerable situation, but we took proper preventive measures - covering with face mask, shield and carried sanitizer. 

Soon we reached the place and were waiting for sample collection in parking, we could see  65 odd people waiting there. In contrary to my expectations there are more than 20 Pregnant ladies and also people waiting to get other surgeries different other ailments have been waiting for 3 to 4 hours in the queue. Moved by these situations and inquired a person who is working in the hospital he replied - an application used internally for maintaining profiles of people is in maintenance. This is baffling normal people who come to screen for the test are exposing to the virus by staying long hours in small confined places like hospitals. I hope public officials should take note of this and refine the process to make testing procedure swift and pleasant.

After 2 hours at back of the hospital, next to mortuary - waiting under tree morbidly. My mother was called by her name to give swab sample from nose,for now fingers crossed as it might take 3 to 4 days to get reports out. Test results will be updated here as in when out.

Thanks for reading!
